          Through highschool I hope to acheive good grades and graduate. I would also like to have fun and join in on the activities the school puts on.
          I want to go to all the dances, as many sport games as I can, and participate in anything else. I also hope to play on the lacrosse team.

          After highschool i hope to go to college. im not sure which college yet though. i do know i want to be in the medical field. i have some ideas 
          on which part of the field i want to be in but i have to look into each one more thoroughly. I am very excited though to know that being in the 
          medical field will mean im helping someone out in some way and that makes me happy. Some of the medical fields ive been looking into are NICU nurse,
          ultrasound tech, anesthesiologist, radiologic techologist, and an MA.
